# product-pricing-page
Here is a cool landing page displaying the pricing options for an imaginary product/SaaS. The "sign up" and "trial" labels have some minor responsiveness when the user hovers or focuses on those elements.
This was designed with mobile and desktop viewers in mind. Product page orientation changes once user reaches a threshold screensize or switches to a different device.
